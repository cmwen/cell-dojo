This is just a project to try out [cell](https://github.com/intercellular/cell). Only learn cell.js for few hours, this comments might mislead. The code is based on the example provided by cell.

## Things I like
- Like the idea to make it easy and simple. No CLI or bundler is required. Easy to get it going.
- Purely javascript, no framework is involved.
- Freedom.

## Things I don't like
- To construct DOM might be tedious. JSX sounds still a better solution.
- Component interoperability is bit tricky, might need more thought on it.
- Require discipline, otherwise, the code base will be very difficult to maintain.
- Need to work out how to resue components.
- Maintain state cross multiple components.

Source code is in docs folder.
